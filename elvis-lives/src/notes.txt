[12:17:24] <David> how do you feel about "Kalamazoo X - The technology conference not about technology"
[12:17:37] <David> the no-tech tech-confernce
[12:17:52] <Matt> hmm
[12:18:05] <David> you need a big "what is this?" at the top
[12:18:11] <Matt> the thing i came up last year that i wanted to put on campus was something about "the other 50% of your job"
[12:18:18] <David> that's good too
[12:19:05] <Matt> from my notebook
"attn: CS students at wmu
this is the other half of your career
(the half that makes you different)"
[12:19:20] <Matt> wrote that down and haven't touched it since, could use some polish, but i like it
